# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start the challenge 100 days of Code and setup the environment to track my progress. 

**Thoughts:** I make wordpress websites for small clients and enjoy doing so. But how is the quality of code and can I become more experienced in javascript and improve my coding so that my creativity will translate itself more easily into better designs. Let's use today to setup the environment and the base level of my coding by taking some tests on freecodecamp

### Day 2: April 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Building the freecodecamp projects to check how rusty my coding is

**Thoughts:** The first projects are mainly on basic html/css. Noticed that I'm a bit impatient and want to finish them as quickly as possible to get into the javascript projects. Maybe I should try to not only meet the criteria to pass but to deliver beautifull results as well. Added on the todo list: after finishing the criteria, spend a few more minutes to make at least one element on the project more beautifull.

### Day 3: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 more freecodecamp projects to assess html/css skills

**Thoughts:** Found peace to just do the bare minimum for these basic projects and keep the projects in stock on my codepen account and plan to come back after a few days and quick sketches on paper to tidy them up and make them pretty. The project doesn't offer any content. This 100 days of coding is not about writing good copy, it is about writing good code.

### Day 4: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Basic javascript projects: making algorithms 

**Thoughts:** This was more on thinking about algorithms then on thinking about JS. My programming background got me through, didn't encounter any specific issues with arrow-functions, binding, ... For the next parts I will have to look into some details about ES6.

### Day 5: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: algorithms part II

**Thoughts:** Focused hour on making algorithms to solve projects on free code camp. Even so focused that I forgot to adjust my log. On the plus side: programming is also possible in a hammock.

### Day 6: April 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: algorithms part III

**Thoughts:** Not an Easter Egg Hunt, but a Bug Hunt today. my latest project wouldn't return the desired results due to some issues with floats, classical numerical issue: 0.0004 - 4 x 0.0001 is not zero.

### Day 7: April 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: finished algorithms and started frameworks

**Thoughts:** Keep It Simple, Stupid! Finished the last algorithm by rethinking the flow. Think before code learned the hard way. Lost half of my 1h of coding yesterday to make functions to check and refactor things that aren't necessary. A good night sleep and one line of code later, the problem is solved. Let's dive into front end frameworks.
