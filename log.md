# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start the challenge 100 days of Code and setup the environment to track my progress. 

**Thoughts:** I make wordpress websites for small clients and enjoy doing so. But how is the quality of code and can I become more experienced in javascript and improve my coding so that my creativity will translate itself more easily into better designs. Let's use today to setup the environment and the base level of my coding by taking some tests on freecodecamp
