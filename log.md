# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start the challenge 100 days of Code and setup the environment to track my progress. 

**Thoughts:** I make wordpress websites for small clients and enjoy doing so. But how is the quality of code and can I become more experienced in javascript and improve my coding so that my creativity will translate itself more easily into better designs. Let's use today to setup the environment and the base level of my coding by taking some tests on freecodecamp

### Day 2: April 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Building the freecodecamp projects to check how rusty my coding is

**Thoughts:** The first projects are mainly on basic html/css. Noticed that I'm a bit impatient and want to finish them as quickly as possible to get into the javascript projects. Maybe I should try to not only meet the criteria to pass but to deliver beautifull results as well. Added on the todo list: after finishing the criteria, spend a few more minutes to make at least one element on the project more beautifull.
